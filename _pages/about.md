I currently work at the Data Science Consulting Firm [STATWORX](https://www.statworx.com/de/) as a Data Scientist
Consultant. Prior to that I was a Data Science Consultant at [EY](https://datascience.ey.com) and an Econometrician at
[Oxera Consulting](https://www.oxera.com/expertise/data-science-and-analytics/).
My main field of work focuses on time series modelling preferably in Python.

Next to work I gathered substantial amount of teaching experience. Currently I am teaching Python programming at the
Data Science school [Data Science Retreat](http://datascienceretreat.com) and [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/full-stack-web-development).
During my time at Goethe University I was a teaching assistant to
[Prof. Dr. Schlag](https://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/abteilungen/finance/lehrstuhl/prof-dr-christian-schlag/home-professur-schlag.html)
(Financial Engineering) and
[Prof. Dr. Entorf](https://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/de/abteilungen/ei/professoren/entorf/team/prof-dr-horst-entorf.html) (Statistics and Econometrics). Further I founded my own teaching Startup called Study42.

During my academic time I worked as a research assistant of [Dr. Boya Wang](http://www.cbr.cam.ac.uk/people/research-associates/boya-wang/) (University of Oxford, Oxford),
[Prof. Dr. Haerdle](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/de/administration/fakultaetsverwaltung/Staff/3010) (Humboldt University, Berlin) and [Prof. Dr. Schmid](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/stat-oek/team/prof-dr-timo-schmid/) (Freie University, Berlin) in the areas
of Small Area Statistics and Smart Derivative Contracts.

My educational background is in Econometrics and Finance, in which I hold a Master's Degree with Distinction from the
University of Oxford and a Bachelor's Degree from the Goethe University Frankfurt.
